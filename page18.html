            ..I am having a hard time.<br>
            It's been two months Love..<br>
            Please try to understand me..<br>
            I don't know, I just want to feel loved, I want to be pampered<br>
            I get insecure that you will take me for granted, I know you don't,<br>
            but I have not had any good experience,<br>
            I have always seen the more I show my liking towards people, they start taking me for granted<br>
            I'm not comparing you, it's just me..<br>
            I can't live without sharing my feelings, but in all the experience I have had, I have seen that the nicer I become towards people, the more I am hurt<br>
            I don't even know why I'm sharing all of this with you, I'm telling you the inner thoughts of mine, which I have never told anyone.<br>
            <br>Every time I start a discussion, it winds up into something else, because this is the stuff I have never told to anyone,<br>
            like for ex, that sports thing the other day, it might be a small thing for a person, but to me it impacts a lot.<br>
            Feelings of me giving too much scares me afterwards<br>
            because this is what happens, I associate my feelings with the action of others, and it hurts if things go the other way.<br>
            I'm talking all this, and don't even know if I'm able to pass the right message, or does this also turns to another regretful incident..
            <br>I am not a perfect boyfriend.. I know that..<br>
            I try too hard to not lose what we have.. but messes up every time.<br>
            and I really feel helpless right now.. I don't know what I'd do without you<br>
            And I miss you.. like A LOT
