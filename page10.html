            He wants him to watch the best shows which he'll like and not spend time on just any show.<br>
            So he just suggests his bf a couple of series,<br>
            but he doesn't watch those, So he gets <i>sad</i><br>
            Then one day, he schedules his assignment so as to talk with his bf side by side.<br>
            but, unfortuntely, his bf was at last of the episodes of series, and is in the mood of completing it.<br>
            Naman is sad that he couldn't get to talk to his loving boyfriend.<br>
            and in this grief, he asks him to talk more.<br>
            But bamn he didn't see it backfiring the other way.<br>
            Well, let's just say <i>misunderstandings</i>.<br>
