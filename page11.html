            What it looked like..<br>
            <br>3. One day his boyfriend, who usually used to have a beard, shaves his beard.<br>
            Dude, you should have seen Naman's reaction. He disapproved of <i>him</i>.<br>
            "He said he doesn't look good"<br>
    </p>
    <p>What he meant..<br><br>
       He thinks his boyfriend looks great in beard.<br>
       If his bf asks him,<br>
       "Hey Naman, do I look better with beard or without it."<br>
       His answer would be, "without beard"<br>
       <br>But does that mean, he <i>diaspproves</i> of his boyfried.<br>
       Does that mean he's into looks only..?
       <br><i>Tragedy?</i>
