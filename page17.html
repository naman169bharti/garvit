            He is having a hard time, since today marks 2 months when he last saw him.<br>
            So, he always remains EXCITED AF to talk to his boyfriend.<br>
            He even.. Uhho, someone's disturbing me.."<br>
        <br> -
        Yess, I am obsessed with you.<br>
        Yess, I am always EXCITED AF to talk to you.<br>
        But I never intend for you to stop doing other things for me<br>
        It's just my selfishness of wanting to feel special, that the way I explain my feelings it sounds like shit that I don't mean<br>
        ..but I never wanna hurt you or your feelings<br>
